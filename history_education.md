# history
Actually it is the memory of someone, et maybe history determines who we are(although I never believe in this).
History may let people more visionary, mais it "should" not let people who do have reves become people who they are not. 
Just a detailed document. That's all. Maybe people can see more from this documantation.

## elementary school

It seems like Grade 3/4, the boys was playing, and a vase was broken.(a little like Washington)
The teacher was very angry, and she said "to be honest" with the authority.
Although the boy didn't know if he broke the flower pot, he stand up and said he broke the vase and paid for it(not by him).
Back to home. The boy was scolded by parents, and parents let him not do this again.
But the boy was already sowed.

Time to Grade 6. The teacher said we needed to advance the performance of her students. So the good students should help the bads in the final exam supervised by others.
"That's not honest!" The boy refused to do that. Only him. And back to home, the boy was still educated by parents,
And he still refused to do that in that day. So the boy also lost a friend.
But this pattern is the beginning, so it will not be the last. Never. It just is followed by the more situations.

To be honest. Grade 3/4 education is more important than Grade 6. And, who did say the result is not important?
