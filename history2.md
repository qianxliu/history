### Company 2(N+0.5)

POV: 
Some people value the appearance, which are totally different with the personalities of X.
F said, the beard, the level, the experience, the something at the first time.
The value of appearance is common. But the key is the definition of the appearance.
Seems like in this time. It is the face, the dress, the something.
An interesting point: F said X's Elang is not good(maybe no one can be compared with his Elang). But F didn't test it.
The apperance, must be not based on the practice. F has an ability to see people from the first appearance.

So in the probationary period, F asked X in a day, and blocked the pathways. No any before warnings.
F can do these in order. That's also a mystery. F seems to have the absolute powers which is interesting. Lambs are led by wolve.
If one man is born lacking of the confidence, he can not debate with a extremely confident man who knowed the Elang. And it's a surprise(NOT ANY BEFORE WARNINGS).
Even X didn't know why, just only one thing. Maybe X questioned the loved person. Maybe X didn't fully understand the daily reports.
The definition of the appearance. The more obedient than the known.
And mysteries with general paranoias(So Elang is not the same). And know little with absolute powers, may know everything.
Generally speaking, Politics and X can not avoid.

In past practices, X always avoided the non-technical role.
Not daily reports because X didn't want to disturb the life of F. But this time, F is too active and X can not avoid.

X don't dream this and remain blank answers.
